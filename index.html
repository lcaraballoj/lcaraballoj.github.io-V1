          <h3>Engineering Intern</h3>
          <p>
            Create important demonstration models that can be used in order to show off the cybersecurity capabilities of Owl’s data diodes. This includes simulating attacks that the diodes can block as well as successfully sending packets of data. These demos utilized two Raspberry Pis sending UDP packets of sensor data to each other with the XDE Radium in the middle to filter out the packets. Along with this demo came close analysis of the documentation of the XDE Radium and the creation of documentation for the demos in order to provide better insight and support of the usability of the XDE Radium. The use of MQTT packages was also explored on a clients order to receive MQTT packages and have them automatically converted to a CSV file in order to store its data in a FTP server.

          <h3>IT Summer Intern</h3>
          <p>
            Worked closely with a small team in order to conduct the IT audit and come up with a way to automate the process through the use of Alteryx workflows and careful documentation of the process. This audit also included cleaning the Active Directory and ensuring that future employees running the audit have a good grasp on the Alteryx workflow. Alteryx was also utilized in the creation of a database to help keep track of medical supplies being distributed to sub-recipients. This Alteryx workflow was created to take in Excel templates into database tables in Microsoft SQL Management Studio.
